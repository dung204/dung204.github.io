  <p>
    Caffè Americano (also known as Americano or American americano) 
    is a type of coffee drink prepared by diluting an espresso with hot water, 
    giving it a similar strength to, but different flavor from, 
    traditionally brewed coffee. The strength of an Americano varies with the number 
    of shots of espresso and the amount of water added.

    Black coffee is simply coffee that is normally brewed without the addition of additives 
    such as sugar, milk, cream, or added flavors. While it has a slightly bitter taste compared 
    to when it is flavored with additives, many people love a strong cup of black coffee.

  <p>
    Espresso is a coffee-brewing method of Italian origin, in which a small amount of nearly boiling 
    water (about 90 °C or 190 °F) is forced under 9–10 bars (900–1,000 kPa; 130–150 psi) of pressure 
    (expressed) through finely-ground coffee beans. Espresso coffee can be made with a wide variety 
    of coffee beans and roast degrees. Espresso is the most common way of making coffee in southern 
    Europe, especially in Italy, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Southern France and Bulgaria.
